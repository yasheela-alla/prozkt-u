# Project Management Board

This is a **frontend-only** application built with **Next.js**, designed to resemble a modern project management board.  
It features tasks, statuses, and deadlines — similar to tools like Trello or Linear — but serves only as a **UI prototype** with no backend functionality.

## Features

- Visual task columns based on status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Editable task titles, descriptions, and due dates
- Drag-and-drop support (if implemented)
- Clean and responsive UI using modern web technologies

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Geist font (via `next/font`)
